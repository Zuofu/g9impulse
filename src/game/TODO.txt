BUGS
----

GAMEPLAY
--------
- player ship rolling (can't be hit, can't shoot)
- charged-up shooting?
- level completion (w/ boss)
- make weapon powerups fractionally incremental (e.g. give enemies much more health and make weapons fractionally better)
- spawn weapon powerups randomly in first half (or third...) of level
- shields (regeneration of shields)?

ENEMIES
-------
- more regular enemy shooting (e.g. random but not bursty or gappy)
- spread "chasers" out more
- enemy groups/group actions
- random-offset spawning
- multiplayer support

SCORING
-------
- after setting high score, pressing start takes you to "show highscore" screen (awkward)
- gaiden-like player rating based on score (e.g. "ninja dog", "ninja master", etc)
- finalize scoring scheme (MORE points!!!)
- point deduction for using nuke

-1 for firing bullet (any weapon)
-1 for firing nuke
+x for killing 

alternate scoring:
"sharp shooter" bonus for accuracy (i.e. no detriment for shooting)
"survivor" bonus for having high health throughout
spawn exactly 5 health randomly throughout the level (i.e. not just randomly)
more health when getting health => more bonus
